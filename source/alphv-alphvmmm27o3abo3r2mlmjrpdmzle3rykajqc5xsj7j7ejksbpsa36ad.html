They showed up, we showed them everything, and even though they had insurance, they kept cutting corners. \n\nThey offered $6 million for the data and decryptor, but they said they could get a significant increase if we waited over the weekendâ€”a tactic used by negotiators. After the weekend was over, they disappeared.\n\nIn particular, this company has horrible Security Management. The CIO was 10 steps behind us and was feeding the Executive team false information on purpose.\n\nOur insiders at this company informed us that they were being pressured to leave by their outside counsel. And as their networks were being taken over, they took weeks to make a decision. \n\nThey repeatedly shifted back and forth, unable to make up their minds, and finally turned to leave. No ill will. Your information is in the final process of being sold. That's all.\n\nThey did not disclose the full amount of data stolen; we downloaded multiple databases from credit bureaus that included personal information about American citizens, even those who had never applied for any of their products From their accesses. They also withheld information about 4 TB of additional data that included comprehensive client data. \n\nLet our efforts today serve as a reminder to all companies who refuse to pay, past and present, that you are not forgotten. We will take action about your data in the future. Paying is the only way to ensure the security of your data. \n\nAttorneys and insurance underwriters who counsel clients to rebel against us ought to be held accountable. You are in our sights, and we know precisely who you are. Nothing done by law enforcement will cause us to stray from our course. ALPHV will withstand this kind of nonsensicism.\n\nMany happy clients of ours exist, whom everyone likes to refer to as victims... \n\nWe think that this is why it's not quite so cut-and-dry. The real victims of this groin measuring battle are the customers of the so called victim caught in the crossfire.
