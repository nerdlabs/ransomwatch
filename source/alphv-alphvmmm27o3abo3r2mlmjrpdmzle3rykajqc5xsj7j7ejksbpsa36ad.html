All PII/PHI in previous posts has been removed for the time-being. Advarra continues to laughably spread misinformation regarding this incident. Their PR teams are working hard clearly. Gadi - this is just the start of it. We won't just let you lie about this incident with no consequences. Alot of explaining to do to your wife & kids.\n\nWe ask that Advarra clients & employees, both current & former, encourage the organization to enter negotiations. We have attached small evidence of our claims of exfiltration.\n\nWe must make it clear that Advarra has an existing insurance policy with their cyber insurer, yet won't exercise it. It really shows how much they care about their colleagues & clients.\n\nWe will leak the data on Saturday, if Advarra does not express its intentions to negotiate before then. Executives have been sent the negotiation URL & token. This is your last chance.","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/ece4527d-8d78-40e4-b3ab-077c54bc4cdb","title":"redacted","dt":1698969322485},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/afa12895-763b-4c9d-ad53-07d4536d03cf","title":"redacted","dt":1698969417966},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/abe88310-95e6-4663-b7b2-c1419c15aa52","title":"redacted","dt":1698969422818},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/69a7a30b-090a-4320-8d5b-4b5bbcd16c98","title":"redacted","dt":1698969426703},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/ad5bb347-6471-4ffe-9a17-23f9ea31ecae","title":"redacted","dt":1698969430529},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/ae118b6d-f6bf-4978-a390-c6bc9498e6cb","title":"redacted","dt":1698969434549},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/2bbaf9fa-a66c-4142-9fb9-f679d34d091b","title":"redacted","dt":1698969441228},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/a059e379-efe6-46d1-a0c3-3dc997e9042c","title":"redacted","dt":1698969445642},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/af286e99-078e-434e-9747-250cc437e597","title":"redacted","dt":1698969450211},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/e4183359-0d84-4ee5-be9b-6d78ae06ac3a","title":"redacted","dt":1698969547300},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/584114cf-6d03-4882-bae5-cff588269a19","title":"redacted","dt":1698969551037},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/6f695d09-ef31-46f3-995a-2e94858be686","title":"redacted","dt":1698969562558},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/92553df8-66f8-4e2f-863a-90be9f5cc72c","title":"redacted","dt":1698971895267},{"id":"/article-attachment/33b70a61-59d1-41a2-bf40-2e46e8c97fc8/48b7feb2-ef2e-4fea-be01-9af60f17f6c6","title":"redacted","dt":1698971898985}],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1698969311517,"updatedDt":1698971933257},{"id":"0521c454-3992-4a8a-be55-23aa77cd3f5c","title":"Contact Cottrell and McCullough","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.cottrelldental.com","country":"unknown","description":"The Contact Cottrell and McCullough clinicâ€™s @cottrell-dental patient data became publicly available as a result of a hacker attack.","message":"Proof of leakage: \nhttps://mega.nz/folder/auJwjCSZ#CJOu8fWFw70fvCnjbY9APA","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/0521c454-3992-4a8a-be55-23aa77cd3f5c/72ef2f06-3422-4af0-ae3f-5bc35670f648","title":"redacted","dt":1698931838377},"attachments":[],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1698931804333,"updatedDt":1698931863554},{"id":"8d25fb31-7a4a-46b8-8814-a6e29279a69b","title":"AF Supply","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://afsupply.com","country":"unknown","description":"-","message":"AF Supply must reach out within 48 hours, or this will post will reflect the exfiltrated data in its entirety","logo":{"id":"/article-attachment/8d25fb31-7a4a-46b8-8814-a6e29279a69b/1f08c448-2167-41e7-9f8e-6e494ab3b0c5","title":"redacted","dt":1698921736088},"attachments":[{"id":"/article-attachment/8d25fb31-7a4a-46b8-8814-a6e29279a69b/43a1fc02-bd0d-492a-a66b-635b7c98ac7c","title":"redacted","dt":1698921754913},{"id":"/article-attachment/8d25fb31-7a4a-46b8-8814-a6e29279a69b/9c84ce92-3d77-4aaa-96ae-bd3a6578167b","title":"redacted","dt":1698921771172}],"fileHosts":[]},"createdDt":1698921704434,"updatedDt":1698921791826},{"id":"34669e73-d3dc-4e2e-85ee-a8db4f106507","title":"HAL Allergy","previewContent":"blank","content":null,"publication":{"url":"https://www.hal-allergy.com/","country":"unknown","description":"HAL Allergy is one of the leading companies in the field of allergen diagnostic and immunotherapies in Europe.
