Walker and his colleagues opened the doors for the first time in 1971, Family Health Center (FHC) has been serving community members who are in need of quality and compassionate healthcare. From humble beginnings in a converted trailer to the current state-of-the-art $10 million facility on the same plot of land at the corner of Paterson and Burdick Streets, FHC has become the county’s only Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). FHC has also been accredited as a community-based health center by the National Committee for Quality Assurance for over a decade.\n\nWhat began as a group of dedicated community advocates, volunteer doctors, nurses and assistants is now, more than 53 years later, one of Michigan’s most highly recognized FQHCs. Our team offers comprehensive health services at three locations, with an additional set of mobile health and dental units. Our staff administers approximately 165,000 patient visits annually as part of our commitment to serve the community members of Kalamazoo.\n\nOur leadership and staff at FHC are also passionate about community engagement. Our annual events include the Dr. Lisandra Soto Dental Day of Caring and Back to School Bash. FHC also provides Medical Assistant training to community members interested in pursuing this career path.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of FHC is our compassionate staff. We are grateful to all our team members who remain dedicated to honoring Mr. Walker’s legacy and mission of keeping our community members healthy and strong. As we continue our mission to provide quality health care to everyone, we remember our promise to treat our patients with dignity and respect.","message":"We took 327 gigabytes of data.
